For this reason, Kubernetes is an ideal platform for hosting cloud-native applications that require rapid scaling, like real-time data streaming through Apache Kafka.",

An operating system is software that manages all of the hardware resources associated with your desktop or laptop. Without the operating system (OS), the software would not function. Linux is distributed under an open source license and is one of the most popular platforms on the planet. (Android is, for example, powered by the Linux operating system.)\n\nSo why should you learn Linux when you want to study up on Kubernetes? Kubernetes is an open-source platform that automates Linux container operations. It eliminates many of the manual processes involved in deploying and scaling containerized applications. In other words, you can cluster together groups of hosts running Linux containers, and Kubernetes helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters.",

    "description": "Architecting on AWS covers the fundamentals of building IT infrastructure on AWS. The course is designed to teach solutions architects how to optimize the use of the AWS cloud by understanding AWS services and how these services fit into cloud-based solutions. Because architectural solutions may differ depending on industry, type of applications, and size of business, this course emphasizes AWS cloud best practices and recommended design patterns to help students think through the process of architecting optimal IT solutions on AWS. It also presents case studies throughout the course that showcase how some AWS customers have designed their infrastructures and the strategies and services they implemented. Opportunities to build a variety of infrastructures via a guided, hands-on approach are also provided.",

    "description": "Data communication is an important part of our daily work, possibly without realizing it. We send e-mail messages, we transfer files and we browse the internet with just a couple of mouse clicks. Protecting this information in transit is paramount. Think about erroneously sending NN medical data to people who are not authorized to see this information, or being faced with data which has been manipulated either accidentally or on purpose without us knowing it. To make sure that communication flows from and to NN are secure, a process is in place that verifies several aspects of these communication flow, such as the security characteristics, the architecture of the solution, the firewall rules that need to be implemented to facilitate the data flow and the authentication that needs to take place before data exchange can occur. This process is known as the RCEC process, where RCEC stands for Review Committee External Connections. Another name that you might have come across is the Connectivity Authority. Same thing, same people, same process.\n\nCourse Topics\nIn this workshop we will see what the RCEC process looks like, who is involved, how it works and what you should pay attention to have the connection design approved. The workshop will focus on the content of the templates that are used to create the connection designs, standard patterns, issues that are blocking for going live, and some theory behind the process.",

    "title": "FinOps",
    "description": "FinOps (short for Cloud Financial Management) is the practice of optimizing Cloud Cost spend. It's a new view that developed in recent years. Companies are slowly moving their operational equipment, hardware, storage, pipelines, databases towards the Cloud.\nWith as side effect that the company's Cloud wallet, is now in the hands of engineers. Before this development Procurement was responsible and in charge of purchases. IT never had to bother themselves with the financial part of the business. And Cloud Spend can easily add up.\nThis created a demand for control and insight in these costs. FinOps creates a bridge between Finance and IT to delve into the Cloud Costs and help Engineers figure out which Cloud Platform services fit best to their needs. And on the other hand helping Finance teams understand the importance of certain features and services.\n\nIf it seems that FinOps is about saving money, then think again. FinOps is about making money.\n\nFinOps is the practice of bringing financial accountability to the variable spend model of cloud, enabling distributed teams to make business trade-offs between speed, cost, and quality.\nAt its core, FinOps is a cultural practice. It’s the most efficient way in the world for teams to manage their cloud costs, where everyone takes ownership of their cloud usage supported by a central best-practices group. Cross-functional teams work together to enable faster delivery, while at the same time gaining more financial and operational control.\nNo longer is a siloed procurement team identifying costs and signing off on them. Instead, a cross-functional FinOps team adopts a definitive series of procurement best practices, enabling them to pull together technology, business and finance in order to optimize cloud vendor management, rate, and discounting.\n​​​​​​​With FinOps, each operational team (workload, service, product owner) can have access the near-real-time data they need to influence their spend and help them make intelligent decisions that ultimately result in efficient cloud costs balanced against the speed/performance and quality/availability of services.\n\nThe faster you can get \\[new] features to market and test them, the better off you’ll be. Incidentally, you also pay back the business faster for the use of capital, which means the business starts making money faster, too.\n'Gene Kim, The Pheonix Project:' A novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping your business Win\n\nIf it seems that FinOps is about saving money, then think again. FinOps is about making money. Cloud spend can drive more revenue, signal customer base growth, enable more product and feature release velocity, or even help shut down a data center.\nFinOps is all about removing blockers; empowering engineering teams to deliver better features, apps, and migrations faster; and enabling a cross-functional conversation about where to invest and when. Sometimes a business will decide to tighten the belt; sometimes it’ll decide to invest more. But now teams know why they’re making those decisions.",

Before containers, if you had multiple applications deployed on the same virtual machine (VM), any changes to shared dependencies could cause strange things to happen—so the tendency was to have one application per virtual machine.",

    "title": "Deploying Managed Clusters",
    "description": "Kubernetes is a powerful tool developed by Google for managing containerized applications in a clustered environment. Kubernetes helps you automate, deploy, scale, and manage containerized applications. It gives you the freedom to take advantage of on-premise cloud infrastructures. It also helps you write better cloud-native applications. Kubernetes is a core tool in DevOps; it gives you the ability to schedule and manage containers (Docker or otherwise) at scale. If you’re looking to use Kubernetes in production and have a better understanding of how to manage your containers using Kubernetes, you are ready to learn about deploying managed clusters.\n\n",
